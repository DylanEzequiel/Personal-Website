        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Dylan Ezequiel, from South America in the equatorial country of
          Ecuador, worth the redundancy. I am currently a student and developer
          in continuous learning, dedicated to web application development
          technologies. In fact, this web page is made with HTML and CSS, and
          maybe JavaScript, technologies/code languages known to be dedicated to
          web application development. Until now, I have remodeled this page
          more than 10 times, all of them changing absolutely all the code,
          because I have an obsession that when I am going to change something,
          I change everything. Everything I've accomplished and learned so far
          wouldn't possibly be possible without W3Schools, this site's honorable
          mention.

          <h3>Honorific Mention</h3>
          <p>
            The W3Schools, is a universal learning web platform on programming,
            written in the English human language, it is a platform with several
            years of existence that has taught and continues to teach millions
            of people daily, weekly and annually since the beginning of the
            millennium approximately, created Originally in Norway. On its
            platform/web application we will find dozens of tutorials, more than
            40, where if you guessed right, the languages dedicated to web
            development predominate, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the ones
            that have the most lessons and chapters all over the place because
            initially , W3Schools was created to teach people to create web
            pages professionally, in fact today it is still the main
            characteristic of the platform. The platform has a Discord server,
            in the same way, of which I am a part and where thousands of people
            also do it, here you can meet more people similar to you in the
            sense of the learning platform they use, the common factor, the
            W3Schools. Here you can also clarify your doubts or suggest bug
            fixes or implementations to the tutorials.

        <h2>Past</h2>
        <p>
          During this year to end, events occurred that changed my life.
          Undoubtedly the most important of all was that more than ever I began
          to dedicate myself seriously to studies as a college student, I
          greatly improved my knowledge in various branches of learning, such as
          grammar and literature, social studies, mathematics and little else
          without Too important in my point of view. The second most important
          thing will be to discover by chance the W3Schools in YouCode, a search
          engine for programmers looking to help and seek help from other people
          specialized in what we are looking for/want. Without W3Schools, I
          would never have unlocked all that content with which I develop this
          web page today, perhaps I would never have had the possibility of
          becoming a true web developer, because I would not have learned the
          HTML and CSS languages correctly. During this year I also achieved
          something unimaginable for me in the academic field, because I managed
          to be the best student in my course in the first semester. And to
          conclude, I learned CSS vaguely, I didn't learn anything correctly in
          the W3Schools, because I only wrote meaningless notes and made code
          without seeing how it worked, I just copied it from the W3Schools and
          that was it, today I relearned CSS and I I continue doing it, after
          having learned HTML in depth, to which I dedicated several months,
          exactly since August 22, 2022, since then I started learning, in this
          journey I met someone special on the W3Schools Discord server, Phil ,
          who in his own way learned HTML, through the tool of the same platform
          called "My learning". Discovering this was beneficial for me, because
          I could have control of my daily learning about everything I learned,
          in addition to that, Phil has inspired me to do many things, including
          this page and this content. Special regards to him.

        <h2>Present</h2>
        <p>
          My trajectory in the academic and programming field has not
          necessarily been easy, however, it has been fun and full of
          unforgettable experiences for me. Speaking more clearly of
          programming, today I dedicate myself to CSS again, after my vague and
          painful first journey in this fabulous style language (style sheet). I
          was also learning other languages like JavaScript, basic cybersecurity
          and version controller, Git. Although I have decided to stop learning
          the latter and the first one because the one is more advanced, and to
          have the common learning order when learning about the fundamentals of
          web development respectively.

      <section>
        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>
          My objectives are clear, basic and practical. My goal is to follow the
          path of common knowledge of every web developer, learn the fundamental
          languages that every developer should know before considering
          themselves as such or entering other branches such as the full
          front-end or the back-end (server side), these languages are HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, from these is that we can learn their variants and
          the most advanced, speaking of the front-end: XHTML, SCSS, TypeScript,
          HTML and CSS frameworks, or JavaScript ones. In addition, front-end
          web developers must have knowledge of basic web page management
          technologies, such as WordPress, although I strongly disagree with
          these very specific requirements. After this, I'll move on from the
          front-end to the back-end, but not before I've practiced enough to
          semi-perfect/master my previously acquired knowledge of languages and
          possibly frameworks. The back-end path is wide and complex at the
          beginning for any beginner, although in the front-end I will
          progressively acquire knowledge and proficiency in any
          technology/language I learn, using my previous knowledge and common
          sense in each programming language especially. When we talk about
          server side, we talk about Git, Node.js, Python, PHP, SQL, XML, Java,
          etc. Version controller, extension of a language on the server side,
          programming languages. Complex in my point of view? Not at all! And
          for the others? Depending on the user's experience in the world of
          programming in my view.
